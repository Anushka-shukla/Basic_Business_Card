  #To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - lib/assets/me.jpg
  
  #fonts:
  #  - family: Pacifico
  #    fonts:
  #      - asset: fonts/Pacifico-Regular.ttf
   
   

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Pacifico
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/Pacifico-Regular.ttf
    - family: Source Sans Pro
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/SourceSansPro-LightItalic.ttf
  
  
     
     
     

  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
